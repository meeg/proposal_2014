\subsection{Muon system trigger rates}
\label{sec:muontrigg}

As in the case of ECal, trigger rates in the muon system are dominated by the beam background. In order to estimate the rates, GEANT4 model of the HPS detector was used where the muon system is described according to the conceptual design presented in Section\ref{sec:muon}. Figure \ref{fig:HPS_view2} shows layout of the system. Each of eight hodoscope layers (four layers in the top part of the detector and four in the bottom) consists of two planes of scintillator strips. In one of planes strips are oriented horizontally, so called Y-plane. In the second, called X-plane, they are oriented vertically. For the readout purposes, the Y-planes are segmented into two parts, left and right (cut exactly at the geometrical mid point of the plane) and are composed of three strips. In Table \ref{tb:muonstrp}, lengths and widths of detector readout segmented (counters) are presented. There is a $14$ cm wide and $3.5$ cm high gap, centered at electron beam direction, introduce in the model to avoid high rate region. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:xymu} this gap will have negligible effect on muon pair detection efficiency from $\ap$ decays.

As an input to GEANT4 detector simulator, events generated in EGS5 were used. The CEBAF beam bunch structure was simulated by sending one bunch 
equivalent of electrons, 5,625 $e^-$'s (6.6 GeV), through 
the target. Then produced secondaries were sent throug the GEANT4 model to simulate detector response. As it was expected, the highest rates are detected in Layer 1 hodoscope and are on order of $\sim 0.7$ MHz (X-strips at the electron beam location and the beam-left Y-strip closest to the beam plane), see Figure \ref{fig:l1rates}.

The coincidence rates between hodoscope planes in a layer and between layers were studied using $16$ ns coincidence time window. In the left graph of  Figure \ref{fig:c1rates} coincidence rates between X- and Y-quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right) of Layer 1 hodoscope are shown. The right graph of the figure shows coincidence rates of respective quadrants of Layers 1 and 2. For the muon trigger coincidence of the first three layers of hodoscopes are required. Rates of the triple coincidence within $16$ ns are shown in Figure \ref{fig:c3rates}. Maximum trigger rates are in beam left quadrants and is on order of $7$ kHz. While further reduction of rates will be possible with inclusion of MIP hits in ECal, the $7$ kHz is already within the limit of HPS DAQ allowed rate.
