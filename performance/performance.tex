\subsubsection{ECal occupancies}

There are two factors limiting the allowable ECal occupancy. First, the ECal readout algorithm uses a window of fixed size to integrate hit energy. This window was set to 140 ns ($35 \times 4$ ns) for the test run, and so the number of hits above readout threshold in a 140-ns time window should be well below 1. Figure \ref{fig:ecal_rate} shows that the maximum rate in any crystal is 500 kHz, which translates to 0.07 hits in 140 ns.

Second, because the FADC only reads out on a rising threshold crossing, each hit above threshold causes dead time for that crystal until the preamp output falls back below threshold. Figure \ref{fig:ecal_deadtime} shows the fraction of time each crystal spends above threshold. The maximum dead time is 0.03, meaning that even the hottest crystal is sensitive to new hits 97\% of the time.
