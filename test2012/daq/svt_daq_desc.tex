%\subsubsection{SVT DAQ}

The SVT DAQ was designed to read out data continuously at 40~MHz from the SVT modules and transfer data 
to the JLab DAQ once a trigger signal is received. It is based on the same overall architecture as the system 
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:svt_daq}. Being only half the size of the HPS SVT, the largest difference is the provision for
individual power and data for each sensor and readout chip from the power supplies and DAQ outside of the vacuum chamber.
This simplification reduced development time and cost at the expense of a large number of connections and vacuum feedthroughs.
With a total of 20 silicon microstrip sensors, each one connected to an onboard hybrid readout 
card hosting five 128-channel APV25 ASICs (shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:hybrid_and_apv25_testrun}), 600 lines for power and data are required.

Without optical conversion inside the chamber as proposed for HPS, analog signals from the APV25 chips are 
carried directly to the ATCA crate located outside the vacuum chamber via multi-twisted-pair cable. 
The amplification and digitization is carried out on a Rear Transition Module (RTM) board designed specifically for the HPS test run. 
On the RTM, a pre-amplifier converts the APV25 differential current output to a voltage output 
scaled to the sensitive range of a 14-bit ADC. The RTM is organized into four sections with each section 
supporting 3 hybrids (15 channels). The ADC is operated at the system clock of 41.667~MHz. 
%The RTM also includes a 4-channel Fiber Optic module and supporting logic which can be used to interface to the JLAB trigger supervisor card.
The ATCA main board, the Cluster on Board (COB), is similar to the one described for the HPS DAQ 
with the important exception that one of the Data Processing Modules (DPMs) functions as the trigger 
interface and there is no Reconfigurable Cluster Element (RCE) module. Instead, the DPMs that package and send the data from the hybrids to 
an external PC through a 1~Gbit/s ethernet connection serve the same purpose as the 
RCE module in the HPS DAQ. Figure~\ref{fig:svtdaq} shows an overall layout of 
the SVT DAQ system used for the test run (compare to Fig.~\ref{fig:svt_daq_overview}).

to the RTM and that an external DAQ PC is used for control and transfer of data to the JLab DAQ.}}

The ATCA crate hosts two COB cards, one supporting four data processing DPMs and the other supporting three data processing DPMs and one trigger DPM for a capacity of 21 hybrids, one more than required. 
The test run RTM and COB boards are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rtm_testrun}.

The external PC supports three network interfaces, two standard 1~Gbit/s Ethernet and one custom low latency 
data reception card. The first Ethernet interface is used for slow control and monitoring of the eight 
DPM modules. The second Ethernet interface serves as the interface to the JLAB data acquisition system. The
low latency network interface is used to receive data from the SVT ATCA crate and supports a low latency, 
reliable, TTL trigger acknowledge interface to the trigger DPM. This PC hosts the SVT control and monitoring 
software as well as the ROC application described above.
