The ECal DAQ system used in the test run is very similar to that described for HPS in Sec.~\ref{sec:fadc_daq}. 
The signals from the ECal modules are sent to a signal splitter. One of the outputs of the splitter is fed to a 
discriminator that also has an internal scaler, and then to a TDC channel. The other output is sent to the 
JLab FADC250 VXS module.
%, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fadc}. 
Two FADC VXS crates are required to 
accommodate both halves of the ECal. The trigger, described in further detail in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:testrun_trigger}, is based on information from the FADC boards and includes a cluster 
finding algorithm using FPGA modules. With the FADCs based system, the energy of clusters used to 
make a trigger decision is determined at the crate level.
