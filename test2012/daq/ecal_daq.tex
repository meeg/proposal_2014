The ECal DAQ system used in the test run is very similar to that described for HPS in Sec.~\ref{sec:fadc_daq}. 
The only significant difference is that in the test run, the signals from the ECal modules were sent to a signal splitter. One of the outputs of the splitter is fed to a 
discriminator that also has an internal scaler, and then to a TDC channel. The other output is sent to the 
JLab FADC250 VXS module, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fadc}.
%, is based on information from the FADC boards and includes a cluster 
%finding algorithm using FPGA modules. With the FADC-based system, the energy of clusters used to 
%make a trigger decision is determined at the crate level.
