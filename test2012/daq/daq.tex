\subsubsection{Test Run Data Acquisition}
\label{sec:testrun_daq}
The test run served as a proof of principle for the proposed DAQ and consequently was very 
close to that proposed for HPS. In consideration of the similarities to the system proposed in Sec.~\ref{sec:daq} 
only the main differences will be highlighted here with results and experiences discussed in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:testrun_performance}.  In general, the contrasts with HPS are mainly due to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a lower ECal cluster resolution and no calibration available at the trigger level together with simpler trigger logic, 
\item a smaller SVT without the need for power and signal aggregation inside the vacuum chamber 
and optical readout, and
\item lower bandwidth links.
\end{enumerate}
The two front-end electronics systems for the ECal and SVT are essentially unchanged compared to the HPS.
The ECal provides 
input to the Level~1 trigger system after which an accepted event is acquired from the two sub-systems 
and are processed in the data acquisition and processing system. The Readout Crate Controllers (ROCs)
 described for HPS are unchanged and installed in every VME, VME64X, VXS crates running 
 mvme6100 controllers with a prpmc880 or pmc280 co-processor modules. A hybrid approach was 
 used for the SVT DAQ in the test run where the ROC ran on a external PC connected to the ATCA crate. 
 Similar to HPS, a Foundry Router was used as the backbone of the DAQ system, providing 1Gbps and 
 10Gbps connections between components and to the JLAB Computer Center. The Event Builder, Event 
 Recorder, and other critical DAQ components ran on 
4-CPU Opteron-based servers, which was sufficient for the test run. The RAID5 test run storage system 
had a 100~MByte/sec capability, high enough for the data rates attained in the test run as 
described below.
