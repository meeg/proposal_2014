One of the main parameters that has the 
largest impact on the main design of the HPS experiment is the occupancies expected 
close to the beam.  The largest contribution comes from electrons scattered to large angles 
in the target. It is worth remembering that HPS is sensitive to scattering angles very far out 
on the tail which has been less explored in past experiments. One of the main goals of the 
test run in 2012 was to evaluate the description of the tails of the multiple scattering in order 
to gain further confidence in our expected detector occupancy. As will be shown below, the 
test run was sensitive to the multiple coulomb scattering description despite the fact that 
the data was taken with a photon beam. The details of the test run conditions are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:testrun2012}. 

Figure~\ref{fig:schematic_testrun_vs_erun} gives a schematic view of the main differences 
between the photon and electron beam setup.

\caption{\small{Schematic comparison of the photon beam setup to the electron beam.}}\label{fig:schematic_testrun_vs_erun}
\end{figure*}
In particular, the angular distribution of the pair produced electron and positions emerging 
from the target has contributions from two sources: {\it i} the pair production angle $\alpha$ 
and {\it ii} the resulting angle from multiple scattering in the target after production. This is 
schematically described in Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic_pair_prod}.

\caption{\small{Schematic description of the relevant angles for pair production in the 
test run.}}\label{fig:schematic_pair_prod}
\end{figure*}
The contribution from both sources to the final angular distribution are comparable. FigureX 
shows the expected distribution of the vertical angle $\theta_y$ for the $e^+e^-$ pair  coming 
out of the converter compared to the pair production angle. {\color{red} Need this figure from Takashi.} 


{\bf Sample Composition}\newline
Since we are primarily interested in measuring the angular 
distributions for the $e^+e^-$ pair we checked that the contribution from photons are negligible. Table~\ref{tab:sample_composition} shows the sample composition. The fraction 
of photons that would deposit energy to reach threshold in the ECal crystals are much less than 2\% without any angular which will further reduce the fraction of photons. 
\begin{table}[]

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}

\end{tabular}

\label{tab:sample_composition}
\end{table}

The photon beam line during the test run presented a relatively large fraction of events 
originating upstream of the converter. This contribution was measured during data taking by 
removing the converter and thus taking data without any target but with all other conditions 
the same. Figure~\ref{fig:tracks_at_converter} shows the vertical position of 
reconstructed tracks in the SVT during data taking with the 1.6\% radiation length converter. 
Note the small satellite peaks visible at about $\pm 8$~mm. 
The same figure also overlays the same distribution for the empty converter 
run which clearly shows that these satellite peaks are due to the upstream backgrounds.

In order to properly normalize the rates the integrated current was measured for the different 
runs. Typically the current was about 30~nA. Table.~\ref{tab:currents} shows the measured integrated currents. {\color{red} Describe how these where measured?}. The uncertainty 
of the measurement is estimated to approximately 5\%.

Taking into account the luminosity the upstream background fraction was 16\%, 52\% and 71\% 
for converter thickness of 1.6\%, 0.45\% and 0.18\%, respectively. 

The measured angular distribution in the ECal for the three target thicknesses are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:ang_distr_data} before and after normalization and subtraction of the upstream 
background contribution.

These measured angular distributions was compared to simulation and 
while the bulk of multiple coulomb scattering and pair production angles 
are well studies in the past {\color{red} (reference to appendix)} HPS 
is sensitive only to the tails of these distributions that are less explored. Note that for HPS 
we are only interested in validating our description of the multiple coulomb scattering as that 
is our main background when running in an electron beam. Since 
what we measure in ~\ref{fig:ang_distr_data} is a convolution of both we use a special event 
generation procedure in the simulation to separate description of the multiple scattering and 
pair production angle: We use EGS5~\cite{egs5} to generate the pair produced $e^+e^-$ pair 
and then pass these four vectors to either {\sc EGS5} or {\sc Geant4}~\cite{geant4} which 
models the multiple Coulomb scattering in the target. Thus the {\sc EGS5} is used to normalize 
the pair production angles and the remaining difference would be coming from the 
multiple scattering description in the two different simulation programs. There exist an unlikely 
scenario that the difference in multiple scattering between the two programs would cancel the difference in multiple scattering. To mitigate this possibility the angular distributions are 
measured for each converter thickness. Since the pair production angle is independent of 
the thickness the relative change between data and simulation for different converter thicknesses only depends on the multiple scattering contribution. 

Figure~\ref{fig:ang_distr_dataMC} shows a comparison between data and the {\sc EGS5} 
simulation where the rates have been normalized to 1~s of beam at a current of 90nA.

A few systematic uncertainties was estimated which include; a 5\% uncertainty on the integrated 
current normalization, limited Monte Carlo statistics, alignment of the ECal and uncertainty 
from the background normalization. The uncertainty from the initial gain calibration of the 
ECal described in Sec.{\color{red} X} was estimated to be less than {\color{red} Y\%, need to check this calibration 
systematic.}.

With the set of conservative systematics the total systematic uncertainty was 
between 10 and 18\%. 

In summary it's clear that the version of  
{\sc Geant4} with the default physics lists overestimates the large angle multiple scattering tail. 
This preliminary result further strengthens our confidence that {\sc EGS5} describes the multiple scattering in the target which is important to understand our expected occupancy and trigger 
rates for HPS. As a side note, since {\sc EGS5} was used to generate the pair 
angle distribution for both simulation described in the result it's interesting to see that the 
ratio of data to that the prediction varied from 0.91 (0.40), 0.77 (0.53) and 0.98 (0.81) for {\sc EGS} ({\sc Geant4}) at 1.6\%, 0.45\% and 0.18\% converter thickness, respectively. If the pair angle distribution were responsible 
for the difference between {\sc Geant4}  and {\sc EGS5} that would show up as a large shift in 
this ratio since the multiple scattering contribution varies. 

There are many steps needed to go from this preliminary result to a real 
measurement. However, this preliminary result further strengthens our confidence that 
{\sc EGS5} is able to properly describe the large angle multiple scattering events in the target 
which is important to estimate our occupancy and trigger rates for HPS discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:performance}.
