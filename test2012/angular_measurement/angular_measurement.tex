Occupancies close to the beam create many of the key challenges in the HPS experiment
and determine the limits of sensitivity to low A$^\prime$ masses.
These occupancies are dominated by electrons which have multiple Coulomb scattered to relatively large angles in the converter. Because HPS is sensitive to scattering angles far out on the tail of the multiple Coulomb scattering distribution, well beyond the angles important in other experiments, care must be taken
to ensure our simulations are correct in this regime.  In particular,
Geant4 overestimates the multiple Coulomb scattering rate by a factor of two  
at large angles as explained in detail in the appendix (see Fig.~\ref{appendix:2}).
One of the main goals of the test run in 2012 was to evaluate the description of the tails of the multiple Coulomb scattering in order 
to gain further confidence in our expected detector occupancy. As will be shown below, data from the 
test run can be used to confirm our model of multiple Coulomb scattering despite the fact that 
all data was taken with a photon beam.

Figure~\ref{fig:schematic_testrun_vs_erun} gives a schematic view of the main differences 
between the photon and electron beam setup.

\end{figure*}
In particular, the angular distribution of the pair produced electron and positions emerging 
from the converter has comparable contributions from {\it i)} the pair production angle
and {\it ii)} the multiple Coulomb scattering of the electron and position in the converter after production, see  Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic_pair_prod}.

The photon beam line during the test run produced a relatively large fraction of pairs 
originating upstream of the converter. This contribution was measured during data taking 
with "empty" converter runs i.e. removing the converter but with all other conditions 
the same. The upstream background measured in the "empty" converter runs was subtracted 
from the other runs, properly normalized using the measured integrated currents detailed in 
Tab.~\ref{tab:currents}.

The background fraction for the there converter thicknesses was 16\%, 52\% and 71\% 
for converter thicknesses of 1.6\%, 0.45\% and 0.18\%, respectively. The background fraction was also 
cross-checked by pointing back tracks reconstructed in the SVT to identify the fraction of tracks not emanating from the converter. This can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:extrapol_converter} (bottom) where small 
satellite peaks at $\pm 10$~mm can be identified as tracks from the upstream background. The angular distribution, after normalization and subtracting the upstream background, are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:ang_distr_data} (right).  We also checked that the contribution from photons to our triggered 
sample was less than 2\% (without angular selections which would further reduce the contribution).
%. To make sure that our distributions are dominated by $e^+e^-$ pair Since we are primarily interested in measuring the angular 
%distributions for the $e^+e^-$ pair we checked that the contribution from photons in our triggered sample are negligible. Table~\ref{tab:sample_composition} shows the sample composition. The fraction of photons that would deposit energy to reach threshold in the ECal crystals are much less than 2\% without any angular selection which will further reduce the fraction of photons.

These measured angular distributions are compared to simulation to validate the modeling of the 
multiple Coulomb scattering. As described in more detail in Appendix \ref{app:sim}, EGS5 is used to generate 
the electromagnetic interactions in the converter while GEANT4 is used to simulate the particles after the converter.  Figure~\ref{fig:ang_distr_dataMC} shows the angular distribution comparing data and 
EGS5 normalized to 1~s of beam at 90~nA beam current.

In summary, the accurate modeling of the multiple Coulomb scattering is fundamental to estimate occupancies and trigger rates for HPS. EGS5 predicts the correct angular distribution across all converter thicknesses while GEANT4 overestimates the rates; with the disagreement increasing  with larger converter thickness. This preliminary result verifies our modeling of the multiple Coulomb scattering using EGS5 for HPS.
%Since EGS5 was used to generate the pair 
%angle distribution for both simulation described in the result it's interesting to see that the 
%ratio of data to the prediction varied from 0.91 (0.40), 0.77 (0.53) and 0.98 (0.81) for {\sc EGS} 
%(GEANT4) at 1.6\%, 0.45\% and 0.18\% converter thickness, respectively. If the pair angle 
%distribution were responsible for the difference between GEANT4  and EGS5 that would show up as a large shift in this ratio since the multiple Coulomb scattering contribution varies. 
%There are more work needed to go from this preliminary result to a real 
%measurement. However, this preliminary result further strengthens our confidence that 
%EGS5 is able to properly describe the large angle multiple Coulomb scattering events in the converter 
%which is important to estimate our occupancy and trigger rates for HPS (see Sec.~\ref{sec:performance}).
