The HPS Test Run was proposed to DOE early in 2011 as the first stage of the HPS experiment. Its
purposes included demonstrating that the apparatus and DAQ systems would work well,
that the trigger rates and occupancies to be encountered in electron-beam running were as simulated,
and that the apparatus would performed as needed to conduct the HPS experiment. It would also
provide valuable experience to the HPS Collaboration in all aspects of designing, building, installing,
and running the experiment at JLAB. It was hoped that the experiment would get dedicated run time
in an electron beam and even, if things performed as expected, that HPS could begin its search for
Heavy Photons. The HPS Test Run was installed on April 19, 2012, and ran parasitically with the HDice
experiment, using a photon beam, until May 18. The JLAB run schedule precluded any dedicated
electron beam running, but the HPS Test Run did get some valuable dedicated photon beam running.

This section briefly reviews the HPS Test Run apparatus, which is a simplified version of the apparatus
described above for the HPS experiment, and demonstrates the feasibility of the detector
technologies proposed for the silicon vertex tracker (SVT), electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal), 
and DAQ systems. It documents the
performance of the trigger, DAQ, SVT, and ECal 
and shows that the performance assumed in calculating the physics reach of the experiment is realistic.
Of particular importance, data from the dedicated photon beam running has been used to compare
the observed trigger rates with that expected in simulation. The trigger rate in the test run is almost 
entirely due to photons which have converted to e$^+$e$^-$ upstream of the detector, 
and is sensitive to the multiple
Coulomb scattering of the electrons in the conversion target. Good agreement between data and
simulation confirm the EGS5 simulation and its description of multiple Coulomb scattering. Since
multiple Coulomb scattering of the electron beam dominates the SVT occupancies and ECal trigger rates
in HPS, confirming the simulation has demonstrated that backgrounds in HPS are understood.

In addition to the important test of our simulation tools, the HPS parasitic tests, staged over the Hall-B HDice run (g14), accomplished the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Integrated SLAC and JLAB readout systems into a single DAQ.
\item Fully tested the Level 1 trigger system based on FADC readout boards.
\item Tested experimental monitoring and controls.
\item Gained experience with running the test apparatus, in particular running SVT in vacuum.
\end{enumerate}

\label{fig:hpstest_layout}
\end{figure}
The SVT was installed inside the Hall~B Pair Spectrometer (PS) magnet vacuum chamber with the 
electromagnetic calorimeter mounted downstream of it.
Both the SVT and the ECal were retracted off the beam plane vertically to allow clean passage of the photon 
beam through the system, and also not to obscure converted (e$^+$e$^-$) pairs from being detected in the 
PS hodoscopes used to monitor the beam. For the portion of the run dedicated to HPS, the 
photon beam was generated in the interaction of the 5.5~GeV electrons with a gold radiator of 
$10^{-4}~X_0$, located $\approx 8$~m upstream of the PS pair converter. After collimation 
(with a opening diameter of 6.4~mm), the photon beam passed through the PS converter and 
through the HPS system. Data were taken with different converter thicknesses 
(empty, $1.8\times 10^{-3}~X_0$, $4.5\times 10^{-3}~X_0$, and $1.6\times 10^{-2}~X_0$) and 
were repeated for reverse field setting of the PS dipole.


\subsubsection{Test Run SVT}

The silicon tracking and vertexing detector for HPS Test, or SVT, operates in an existing vacuum chamber 
inside the pair spectrometer (PS) analyzing magnet in Hall~B at JLab.  The design principles of the SVT are 
described in further detail in the HPS Test Run Proposal~\cite{HPS_tPROP}. There are five measurement 
stations, or ``layers,'' placed immediately downstream of the target. Each layer comprises a pair of 
closely-spaced planes and each plane is responsible for measuring a single coordinate, or ``view.'' 
Introduction of a stereo angle between the two planes of each layer provides three-dimensional tracking and 
vertexing throughout the acceptance of the detector with one redundant layer. 

In order to accommodate the dead zone, the SVT is built in two halves that are mirror reflections of one 
another about the plane of the nominal electron beam.  Each half consists of five double-sided modules 
mounted on a support plate that provides services to the modules and allows them to be moved as a group 
relative to the dead zone. Each module places a pair of silicon microstrip sensors back-to-back at a specified 
stereo angle with independent cooling and support.

The first three layers have a 100~mrad stereo angle to provide higher-resolution 3D space points for 
vertexing. The 50~mrad stereo angle of the last two layers breaks the tracking degeneracy of having five 
identical layers and minimizes fakes from ghost hits; improving pattern recognition while still providing 
sufficient pointing resolution into the third layer for robust hit association in the denser environment there. 
These stereo angles are the same as those proposed in Sec.~\ref{sec:svt} for the new SVT. More details 
of the properties of the five layers can be found in Tab.~\ref{tab:trk} and a solid model of the detector layout 
is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:tracker_model}.

Altogether, this layout comprises 20 sensors and hybrids and 100 APV25 chips for a total of 12780 readout 
channels. 


Power is provided to each hybrid using CAEN power supplies provided by Fermilab. Three low voltages are 
supplied for the APV25 and one high voltage to reverse bias the sensor. The supplies that provide sensor 
bias are capable of 500~V operation and was chosen to be able to test 
operation at high voltage needed in close 
proximity to an electron beam. The total power consumption of each hybrid during normal operation is 
about 2 W, which is removed with the water-glycol cooling system. Care was exercised in selecting power 
and data cables, to ensure vacuum compatibility and sufficient radiation hardness. 
The teflon-coated twisted pair 
copper wires selected are rated for 400~kRad, well above the expected exposure of 20~kRad/week. 
A special purpose junction box interfaces the CAEN power supply output channels to the SVT hybrids. 
Control of the supplies is provided via an EPICS graphical user interface, which provides interlock protection 
in addition to detector monitoring.

The linear shifts that define the opening of the two tracker halves of the SVT are controlled by a pair 
of stepper motors located in low field regions at the upstream end of the PS magnet. For photon running, 
these are locked in the open position, but for electron running they would be connected and controlled 
through EPICS so that the distance between the beam and the sensors can be adjusted to balance detector 
occupancies and acceptance.


\subsubsection{Test run ECal}

The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) for HPS, described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ecal}, was built and tested in 
the test run. The only differences between that and the test run ECal are the vacuum chamber and the 
position on the beam line. 

The vacuum chamber between the two ECal halves was not used for the photon test run. 
Instead, a 2'' beam pipe was used to transport the photon beam from the pair spectrometer vacuum 
chamber to the HDIce target. The ECal was mounted immediately downstream  of the PS dipole magnet, 
$\sim 148$~cm from the upstream edge. The two ECal half-modules, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ecal_assembly}, 
are positioned just above and below the beam pipe such that the edge of the crystals closest to the beam is 3.7~cm from it.

\end{figure*}
%{\color{red} check beam pipe diameter: 2 inch, 3 inch or 2.5 inch?}
%It centered relative to the beam that passes in between two parts of ECal through $3$ inch beam pipe.
%In order to maintain stable performance of the PbWO$_4$ calorimeter, the crystals and APDs are enclosed within a temperature stabilized environment, held constant at the level of $1~^o$F. The expected energy resolution of the system from operational experience with the IC is $\sigma_E/E \sim 4.5\% / \sqrt{E (GeV)}$. As in the IC, PbWO$_4$ modules are connected to a motherboard that provides power to and transmits signals from individual APDs and pre-amplifier boards. Crystals inside the box are supported by aluminum frames, Figure \ref{fig:ecal_assembly}.
For the HPS test run the ECal used existing low and high voltage systems from the CLAS/IC, as well as 
signal cables and splitters. Connectors on the existing signal cables have been rearranged to accommodate 
the new layout of the channels. 
Figure~\ref{fig:ecal_mounted} shows the ECal in its installed position for the HPS test run.

\subsection{Test Run Apparatus Performance} 
\label{sec:testrun_performance}
As noted above we only had the opportunity to tun the HPS test apparatus in the 
photon beam mode. The Hall-B pair 
spectrometer (PS) converter was used as a target, located $\sim 67$~cm from the first layer 
of the tracker. This section will report on a few selected preliminary results that demonstrates 
our understanding of the main characteristics of the system.
