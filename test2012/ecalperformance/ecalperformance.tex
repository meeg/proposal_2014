\vspace{1cm}{\bf ECal performance [Sho]}


Describe clustering, thresholds, occupancy, dead/noisy crystals, flip in readout?

Plots: Occupancy map

\vspace{1cm}{\bf ECal Calibration [Sho]}


Description of the gain calibration. Relate to how good it needs to be which should be in the performance section. Discussion of sampling fraction. Relation to what calibration that is needed for the trigger in 2014?

Plots: E/p map before and after calibration, spread in gain, E/p data/MC


\vspace{1cm}{\bf Trigger performance [Sho/Ben]}


Describe trigger algorithm. What were the rates, lessons learned?

Plots: Compare observed and expected trigger time {\it Sho}, Tag\&probe {\it Sho}, rates vs time {\it Ben/Sho/Pelle}
