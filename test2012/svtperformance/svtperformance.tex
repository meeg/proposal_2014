\vspace{1cm}{\bf SVT timing [Sho]}

The time reconstruction algorithm described in \ref{sec:svt≈ß} was used to fit a single hit to each SVT channel in each event.
Pileup was not considered due to the very low hit rate in the SVT.

Values of fit $\chi^2$ fell in the distribution of $\chi^2$ for 4 degrees of freedom (6 points -- 2 fit parameters), as expected.

After clustering these hits, the hit time for the cluster is computed as the amplitude-weighted average of the channel hit times.

Plots: example time fits, mean hit times across tracker, plot of simulated time resolution vs S/N?
