During the dedicated photon running the SVT had all 20 hybrids and the APV25 chips operating at their 
nominal operating points~\cite{Jones:1069892} and the sensors reverse-bias at 180~V.  The sensors were 
operated at X$^\circ$C throughout the test run. Multiple calibration runs established a noise level of 60-68 
ADC counts (X-Y electrons) which was stable across all hybrids. With a linear gain up to $\approx 3$~MIPs, the 
cluster charge for hits on a track follow the characteristic Landau shape (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cluster_pulse}) with a 
mean of about 26,000~e$^{-}$ as expected. This signal response gives a signal-to-noise ratio of about 25.5.

One of the important tests of the SVT was the operation of the APV25 chips in multi-peak readout mode 
discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:svt}. The six samples of the APV25 pulse shaper output 
are fitted to an ideal $CR-RC$ function to extract the amplitude and the $t0$ of the hit. 
The typical cluster shape obtained is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cluster_pulse} also demonstrates that the SVT was well timed in to the trigger with the rise of the pulse at the 3rd sampling point.
After clustering hits on a sensor, the hit time for each cluster is computed as the amplitude-weighted average of 
the fitted $t0$ channel times. The $t0$-resolution is studied by comparing the cluster hit time with the average of all cluster hit times, the "track time". Figure~\ref{fig:} shows the track time, with the expected jitter due to clock phase and trigger, and the residual to the individual cluster times. 
\begin{figure}[h]

	The cluster time residual is for a representative sensor relative to the track time.}}
	\label{fig:tracktime}
\end{figure}
After correcting for offsets from each sensor (time-of-flight, clock phase) the extracted $t0$ resolution is 2.6~ns (larger than the 2.4~ns due to correlations between the cluster and "track" times). This is somewhat worse than the $\approx 2$ ns resolution expected in Sec.~\ref{sec:performance} which we attribute to our pulse shape fit procedure function (see Appendix for more details). 

Throughout the test run, approximately 97\% of the 12,780 channels in the SVT was functional. The identified dead or noisy channels were largely attributed to a 
known noisy sensor and a few noisy or misconfigured chips which will be resolved for future running. The 
increased noise also led to higher occupancy and data rates than what was expected for the photon run. 
Good agreement between simulation and test run data was achieved after masking out all known noisy 
channels found during SVT commissioning, see Fig.~\ref{fig:data_rates_data_mc_cmp} (see Appendix for more details).

Clustered hits within each sensor layers are combined to 2-dimensional stereo hits which used by the tracking 
algorithm to form tracks. Figure~\ref{fig:hit_track_efficiency} shows the track finding efficiency estimated on simulated photon beam events to be about 98\%.

\end{figure}
The hit efficiency in the sensor layers was measured in data with four hit tracks extrapolated to the remaining layer. Excluding the known bad channels and chips, the hit efficiency was approximately 99\%, more details are given in Appendix.
