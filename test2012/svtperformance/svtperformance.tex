As described in Sec.~\ref{sec:svt} the six sample readout is crucial in order to time-correlate 
hits in the tracker to lower the confusion rate in the pattern recognition during electron running. 
The time reconstruction algorithm described in \ref{sec:svt} was used to fit a single hit to each SVT channel in each event. The fit quality $\chi^2$ was shown to agree with the expected distribution 
for four degrees of freedom for an ideal $CR-RC$ function.

After clustering hits on a sensor, the hit time for the each cluster is computed as the 
amplitude-weighted average of the channel hit times. Since we have no measurement of the ``true'' hit time, we study the overall SVT hit 
timing performance using the average of all cluster times in a track as the ``track time,'' and take the
 residual of the cluster time relative to that. The observed track time, shown in Figure \ref{fig:tracktime}, has the expected amount of trigger jitter due to the readout clock and trigger 
 system jitter. After correcting for offsets for each sensor (time-of-flight, clock phase) the RMS 
 of the final residual distribution is roughly 2.4~ns for each sensor. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{test2012/svtperformance/track_time_top}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{test2012/svtperformance/timeres}
	\caption{\small{Track time distribution (top) and cluster time residual (bottom). The 
	track time is measured relative to the APV25 clock. The width of the distribution is due to 
	trigger jitter (24 ns jitter in tracker readout clock, plus 16 ns jitter in the trigger system). 
	The cluster time residual is for a representative sensor relative to the track time.}}
	\label{fig:tracktime}
\end{figure}
Because the track time is calculated using the individual hit times, the hit time is positively correlated 
with the track time; thus the RMS of the residual is slightly smaller than the true time resolution.
The standard deviation of this residual for $n$-hit tracks where all hits have the same time resolution 
is reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{(n-1)/n}$; since most of our tracks have 8 clusters, the true time 
resolution is 2.6 ns. 
%\begin{figure}[ht]
%	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{test2012/svtperformance/timeres}
%	\caption{\small{Histogram and Gaussian fit of residual of cluster times for a representative sensor, relative to the track time. Because the cluster times and track time have positive covariance, the true time resolution is slightly larger than the standard deviation shown here.} }

%\begin{figure}[ht]
%	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{test2012/svtperformance/hit_dt}

%	\label{fig:hit_dt}
%\end{figure}
This is somewhat worse than the $\approx 2$ ns resolution expected (see Fig.~\ref{fig:timeres} in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:performance}, but we believe this discrepancy is due to our fit function. Our pulse 
shape fit assumes an ideal CR-RC pulse shape; since the actual pulse shape has a slower rise time, 
there is a systematic pull on the hit time when a hit comes immediately before the APV clock time. 
This is visible in Figure \ref{fig:timeres_2D} as a shift in the residual at certain values of track time.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{test2012/svtperformance/timeres_2D}
	\caption{\small{Plot of the time residual for a representative sensor vs. the track time. 
		The kinks in the horizontal band are caused by the fitter; without them the 1-D histogram in Figure \ref{fig:timeres} (the projection of this histogram) would be narrower.} }
	\label{fig:timeres_2D}
\end{figure}
Work is in progress to use the actual pulse shape in time reconstruction; this should improve time resolution to that expected from previous studies. 
It should be noted that the demonstrated time resolution above is still adequate to achieve a good 
enough rejection due to pile-up hits in the HPS electron run.
