In order to prepare the SVT for real physics data-taking, the SVT was 
calibrated. This involved the extraction of the mean baseline (pedestal),
noise and gain for each of the 12,780 SVT channels. All measurements
were made with the APV25 readout chips configured to their nominal operating
points \cite{Jones:1069892} and all sensors biased to 180 V. The APV25s were
operated in ``multi-peak'' mode with six samples being readout per trigger.
This, in turn, allowed for the extraction of the $t_0$ and amplitude of the 
signals being read out.

Figure~\ref{fig:pedestal_noise} shows an intensity plot of the pedestals 
along with the readout noise as a function of channel number for a single
hybrid.  The noise was computed by taking the RMS of the Gaussian distributed

pedestals for each of the channels and was observed to be consistently within 
60 - 68 ADC counts ($\approx$ 667 - 756 electrons).  
Figure~\ref{fig:pedestal_noise} also demonstrates a feature common amongst 
all APV25 readout chips, mainly the large values of noise for channels 
lying near the chip edges.  This was also  observed by the CMS 
collaboration and the cause is still under investigation.

Another aspect which is crucial to full characterization of the SVT is an 
understanding of the signal response and the associated gain.
Using the APV25 internal calibration circuitry, a known fixed charge was 
injected into all channels.  This allowed for the accurate determination
of the signal response along with its scaling with input charge.

As shown on Figure~\ref{fig:gain}, the response exhibits good linearity up 
to $\approx$ 3 MIPs while the gain uniformity was within the expected range 
across all chips on a hybrid.

All reconstructed hits in an event were used to form clusters of energy 
depositions using a nearest neighbor algorithm. Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_pulse}
shows the mean pulse shape of each of the hits associated with a track as a 
function of time.

timed in with the tracker. Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_pulse} also shows the MIP

of 25.5 which is well matched to the value expected from first principles.
