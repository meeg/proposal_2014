The expected data rates and event sizes for each of the dedicated photon runs
were estimated using a full simulation of the SVT DAQ and compared to observed
values. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:testrun_daq}, the digitized samples
from three hybrids were received by a single DPM.  The DPM then required that
at least three of the six samples exceeded a threshold of two times the noise
level for that channel.  An additional ``pile-up'' cut requiring that 
(sample 2 $>$ sample 1) or (sample 3 $>$ sample 2) was also applied. This was
meant to eliminate hits arising from the falling edge of previous hits expected
to occur when running at the highest occupancies.
%Signals from the photon run were unaffected by such a cut. 

All samples were placed into their own container along with the 
channel number, hybrid identifier, chip address and DPM identifier. An 
additional layer of encapsulation or bank was used to store all samples 
emerging from a single DPM along with the DPM identifier, the event number
an error bit and hybrid temperatures. A diagram of the container along with
the sizes of each of the elements is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:data_format}.

                    processed by a single FPGA and are placed within a single
                    container or FPGA bank.  An additional layer of 
                    encapsulation is used to store all of the FPGA banks.

Overall, the container overhead will contribute a total of 326 bytes to an event
with an additional 16 bytes per hit.

corresponding event size and data rate are shown on Table~\ref{table:sim_rates}.

The occupancies shown include a contribution of .02\% (3 hits) due to noise and  
data rates are estimated using the trigger rates observed during each
of the dedicated photon runs. As expected i.e. thicker targets correspond to higher 
occupancies.

rates for each of the targets.  The data rates observed during the test run were
much higher than expected.  This can be attributed to a known
noisy sensor and a few noisy chips which appeared during certain runs.  The causes
of both these issues are now well understood and will be resolved for future running.

A better comparison between simulated and observed data rates can be obtained
by masking out all known noisy channels found during the commissioning of the 
SVT.  The resulting data rates are listed on Table~\ref{table:masked_rates}.
