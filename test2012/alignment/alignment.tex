%Good alignment of the SVT is critical to achieving the expected tracking performance and physics reach. 
%The sensors must be aligned internally and with respect to the target and other beam line components for optimal performance. 
%The alignment of the test run apparatus proceeds in several steps which must be tied together to achieve the final alignment.
%These include survey measurements of various SVT assemblies, a beam line survey at JLab, and finally 
%a track-based alignment. 

The SVT was aligned using a combination of optical, laser and touch probe surveys at SLAC and JLab. The 
optical survey of individual modules with precision of a few microns are combined with a touch-prove survey 
of the overall SVT support structure, with 25-100 microns precision, to locate the silicon sensor layers with 
respect to the support plates and the mechanical survey balls on the base plate.
%Mechanical surveys using touch probes was performed on the two SVT tracker planes before 
%shipping to JLab. This survey measured reference points on the base plate, C-support and on the surface of the tracker support plates. These positions where then tied to very precise optical survey of each sensor module, referencing the silicon sensor position w.r.t. to the cooling blocks. 
%An important aspect of the mechanical survey is the relatively large sag of 
%the 70~cm long support plate which is supported by the C-support hinge on one end and the 
%extension bar attached to the linear shaft at the other. The measured sag without all services 
%(cooling manifold and cables was not dressed at this point) was more than $250~\mu$m.  
%For HPS, only the first three layers are being supported from each end which will reduce this 
%sag with at least a factor of four. {\color{red} check this}. The goal of the mechanical surveys is 
%to reach a relative alignment of the 
%silicon to about $100-200~\mu$m where alignment using tracks become feasible and the 
%improvements from mechanical surveys become harder. 
After full assembly and installation of the SVT at JLab, a mechanical survey of the SVT base plate position 
inside the pair spectrometer vacuum chamber is used to determine the global position of the SVT with respect 
to CEBAF beam line. 
%at the as-built alignment.  The sag
%of the long support plates and lever arms used in the test run are the dominant error in determining
%relative modules positions, a defect addressed in the proposed design for the SVT.
%Finally at JLab, with a fully assembled 
%tracker, an optical and touch probe survey was performed to locate 
%the SVT inside the vacuum chamber, using the measurements of the base plate, in the reference coordinate system of 
%the analyzing magnet. 
The resulting survey-based alignment has the position of the silicon sensors correct to within a few hundred 
microns as shown in the mean of the biased track residuals in Fig.~\ref{fig:res_top}.  The large multiple scattering contribution can be seen by the large increase in the width of the residuals in the later layers. The agreement with simulation is reasonable; a slight track reconstruction algorithm bias can be seen in the mean for the simulation in later layers which will be fixed in the future. 
%This level of internal alignment 
%shows that the survey approach, while not perfect, is adequate as a starting point to bootstrap the SVT 
%alignment. 
%At this level of internal 
%alignment   an internal SVT alignment with track residuals less than a few 
%hundred microns shown in .  is then studied using reconstructed tracks in the SVT. The main observable of the internal alignment of the silicon 
%sensors is the so-called track residual. It is 
%defined as the difference of the measured and predicted track 
%position at that sensor. Figure~\ref{fig:res_top} 
%shows representable 3D space point track residuals, relative to track parameters determined at the target, for tracks reconstructed in the top half of the tracker.

%In electron running, the beam spot can be used as a constraint in the global track-based alignment. 
We also extrapolate the reconstructed tracks back to the converter located $\approx 77$~cm 
from our first silicon layer to understand the tracker alignment w.r.t. to the other components on the 
beam line. Figure~\ref{fig:extrapol_converter} shows good agreement of the reconstructed track position at the converter with that predicted from simulation using the measured field map of the analyzing magnet to take into account the fringe field. The offset of the horizontal position simply reflects the fact that the positions are reconstructed in an SVT-centered coordinate system, which is tilted with respect to the beam coordinate system.

%The width is roughly consistent with between data and simulation with a shift in the bend-plane 
%coordinate for tracks in the bottom half which is likely due to alignment or incomplete description of the 
%magnetic field at the edge of the magnet. 
%There are two small bumps in the vertical position in the data arising from backgrounds 
%originating upstream of the converter verified using the run without a converter.
%The luminous region, inferred from harp scans of the photon beam profile, has a width of about 1~mm 
%%(best described by a double Gaussian: $0.71e^{\frac{x}{0.366}}\times 0.29e^{\frac{x}{1.111}}$)
%and a total beam envelope of around 7~mm. The small bumps in data at $\pm10$~mm 
%are from particles produced upstream of the converter. The width and position of the tracks 
%are roughly consistent with the expected distribution from an ideal geometry as shown by the simulated 
%tracks in the same figures. The larger shift in the bend direction for bottom tracks 
%is still under investigation. 

With initial residuals less than $\sim 500~\mu$m across all layers of 
the tracker and a reconstructed beam profile similar to that expected from simulation, it appears these survey techniques 
are adequate to bootstrap the SVT alignment. 
For HPS, we are developing a more sophisticated global track-based alignment technique to reach 
the final alignment precision. This framework will also enable us to explore and understand important details 
such as weak modes and how dedicated alignment runs 
(e.g. with magnetic field off or with different targets) may shape operational procedures during HPS running.

%The width of the beam can be described by a double Gaussian $0.71e^{\frac{x}{0.366}}\times 0.29e^{1.111}$ which is also used in the simulations. The beam envelope extends out to
