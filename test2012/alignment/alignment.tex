A good alignment of the SVT is an important factor to reach our expected tracking performance 
and thus the expected physics reach sensitivity. The SVT sensors has to be internally aligned but 
also known with respect to the target and other beam line components for optimal performance. 
The alignment of the test run apparatus is divided into several steps which aims to tie together 
several different survey measurements on the SVT to the beam line survey at JLab and finally 
a track-based alignment starting from a pre-aligned SVT. 

Mechanical surveys using touch probes was performed on the two SVT tracker planes before 
shipping to JLab. This survey measured reference points on the base plate, C-support and on the surface of the tracker support plates. These positions where then tied to very precise optical 
survey of each sensor module, referencing the silicon sensor position w.r.t. to the cooling blocks. 
An important aspect of the mechanical survey is the relatively large sag of 
the 70~cm long support plate which is supported by the C-support hinge on one end and the 
extension bar attached to the linear shaft at the other. The measured sag without all services 
(cooling manifold and cables was not dressed at this point) was more than $250~\mu$m.  
For HPS, only the first three layers are being supported from each end which will reduce this 
sag with at least a factor of four. {\color{red} check this}. The goal of the mechanical surveys is 
to reach a relative alignment of the 
silicon to about $100-200~\mu$m where alignment using tracks become feasible and the 
improvements from mechanical surveys become harder. Finally at JLab, with a fully assembled 
tracker, an optical and touch probe survey was performed to locate 
the SVT, using the measurements of the base plate, in the reference coordinate system of 
the analyzing magnet. 

The alignment after processing and using the survey measurements are studied using 
reconstructed tracks in the SVT. The main observable of the internal alignment of the silicon 
sensors is the so-called track residual. It is 
defined as the difference of the measured and predicted track 
position at that sensor. Figure~\ref{fig:res_top_nonbend} and~\ref{fig:res_top_bend} 
shows representable 3D space point track residuals 
for tracks reconstructed in the top half of the tracker.

These are compared to the residuals from an ideally aligned tracker with residuals centered at zero.
Note the larger width for the downstream layers,highlighting the large 
multiple scattering contribution in the track reconstruction. 
The intrinsic single hit resolution of $\approx 6~\mu$m is negligible for layers beyond the second. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:res_top_summary} shows a summary of the mean residuals for each layer of the tracker 
after the mechanical survey alignment constants has been applied.

To understand the tracker alignment w.r.t. to the other components on the beam line we 
use the reconstructed tracks and extrapolate them outside the tracking volume. 
Figure ~\ref{fig:extrapol_converter} shows a comparison of the track position propagated 
to the converter enabling us to get a better understanding of the tracker alignment with 
respect to the beam line.

The luminous region, inferred from the photon beam profile HARP 
scans, has a width of about 1~mm 
%(best described by a double Gaussian: $0.71e^{\frac{x}{0.366}}\times 0.29e^{\frac{x}{1.111}}$)
and a total beam envelope of around 7~mm. The small bumps in data at $\pm10$~mm 
arise particles upstream of the converter. The width and position of the tracks 
are not too far of the expected distribution from an ideal geometry as shown by the simulated 
tracks in the same figures. There is an apparent larger shift in the bend direction for bottom tracks 
that is still under investigation. 

The relatively good alignment with residuals below $\sim 500~\mu$m across each layer of 
the tracker after mechanical survey only gives confidence that our survey techniques are adequate. 
It is also worth noting that the description of the luminous region is also reasonably close to what 
is expected from simulation with an ideal geometry. We are currently finishing developing 
a track-based alignment framework that will allow us to reach 
the ultimate alignment precision needed to reach the expected tracking performance. 
This framework will also give us the possibility and 
flexibility  to explore and understand important details such as weak modes and how dedicated alignment runs with magnetic field off or with different targets may play into our operational 
procedure in HPS.

%The width of the beam can be described by a double Gaussian $0.71e^{\frac{x}{0.366}}\times 0.29e^{1.111}$ which is also used in the simulations. The beam envelope extends out to 
%about 7mm.
