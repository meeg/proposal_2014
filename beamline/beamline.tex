 \subsection{HPS beamline}
 \label{setup:beamline}
 
The Hall-B beam line, magnetic elements, beam profile monitors, and beam position and current monitors upstream of the HPS setup will be 
used as is (after slight modifications for 12 GeV). The only modification needed for the upstream part of the beam line is the addition of 
a collimator upstream of the Hall-B tagger magnet. The role of the collimator is to prevent the beam from directly hitting the Si-tracker in an 
event in which the high intensity beam can move up or down from its nominal position. The collimators, which  can consist of  a $1$ cm 
thick tungsten plates with different size oval holes (to match the beam profile), can be incorporated into the Hall-B photon tagger radiator ladder 
to provide vertical alignment. Horizontal alignment of the whole system will also be needed for fine tuning of the collimator position 
relative to the beam. Downstream of the HPS setup, there will be two beamlines, the electron beam line that will transport electron beam to the 
Hall-B electron beam dump, and a photon beam line that will transport the photon beam generated in the target to a photon beam dump mounted 
on the space frame. The electron beam will be transported in vacuum all the way through to the beam dump. Following the vacuum 
chamber in the last chicane dipole, the photon beam will go to the dump in Helium bag. There will be an H-corrector installed on the electron 
line after 
the HPS chicane to compensate any possible mis-steering of the beam in the chicane and to make sure that the electron beam stays on the 
original beamline to the dump. A YAG viewer will be used to monitor beam position jsut before the dump. The beam position on the dump monitor 
must stay unchanged before and after energizing the chicane.  
 
 \subsubsection{Layout of the HPS setup} 
 \label{setup:layout}
 
The HPS experiment will use the same three magnet chicane that was used for the CLAS Two Photon Exchange experiment (TPE). The layout of 
the beam line and the chicane is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ebeam}. The Hall B pair spectrometer magnet, an 18D36 (pole length $91.44$ cm, 
gap $45.72\times 15.24$ cm$^2$, max-field $1.5$ T), will serve as the analyzing magnet. The dipole field direction (Y) is perpendicular 
to the horizontal (XZ) plane. The Hall B “Frascati” H magnets (pole length $50$ cm, gap $21\times 8.25$ cm$^2$, max-field $1.2$ T) 
will be used as the first and the last dipoles of the chicane. The analyzing magnet will be operated at a $0.25$ T-m field for $1.1$ 
GeV, a $0.5$ T-m field for $2.2$ GeV, and a $1.5$ T-m field for $6.6$ GeV running. The two bending magnets will be set to  $0.125$ 
T-m, $0.25$ T-m, and $0.75$ T-m fields, respectively. The distance between the centers of the magnets will be about $50$ cm bigger than 
it was for the TPE run, to accommodate the muon system. The location of the analyzing magnet along the beam will be exactly the same  
as it was for the TPE run. 

The analyzing magnet will be displaced to beam left by $\sim 11$ cm in order to optimize the detector acceptance for e$^+$ 
and e$^-$, see Figure \ref{fig:ebeamt}.

(110 mm) to beam's left to get optimal acceptance for both $e^+$s and $e^-$s.}}\label{fig:ebeamt}
\end{figure*}

 
The HPS target is positioned at the upstream edge of the analyzing magnet's pole. The distance from the target to the first layer of the 
silicon tracker is $10$ cm, and to the face of the electromagnetic calorimeter $\sim 137$ cm. There is continuous vacuum for the electron 
beam throughout the entire setup ending in the Hall B electron beam dump. The Si-tracker and the target will be located inside the Hall-B 
pair spectrometer vacuum chamber. The SVT vacuum box is mounted on the upstream end of the analyzing magnet vacuum chamber to provide 
connections for the SVT motion system, the cooling system, power and signal cables, and the target motion system. The Ecal vacuum chamber 
is attached to the downstream end of the analyzing magnet vacuum chamber, above and below which are placed the Ecal modules. Downstream of 
the Ecal vacuum chamber, another vacuum chamber is attached, leading through the muon system and the downstream chicane magnet.

The analyzing magnet, the Hall B pair spectrometer dipole, has its own power supply. The “Frascati” H magnets will use one common power 
supply and will be powered by the Hall B "mini-torus" power supply. There will be a shunt installed between the two “Frascati” magnets 
to allow independent small changes in currents on those two magnets if necessary (as it was done during the TPE experiment, although 
never used). Both power supplies are bipolar, so the magnets can be degaussed when needed. From available field map data at $900$ A, 
the$\int{Bdl}$ of Frascati H magnets along the path of the electron beam is $0.663$ T-m. The specified max current for these magnets 
is $950$ A. In order to get $0.75$ T-m an additional $10\%$ increase in field value will be needed. From initial evaluation of the 
magnet design and characteristics, it should not be a problem to run them at $10\%$ higher currents over their specified max current. 
If this is not possible, reducing the gap by $1/3$ inch can yield the desired $\int{Bdl}$.

\subsubsection{Running Conditions} 
 
The HPS will use $\sim 1.1$ GeV, $\sim 2.2$ GeV, and $\sim 6.6$ GeV electron beams of up to $500$ nA incident on a thin tungsten (W) target. 
Operational experience (with 6 GeV machine) showed that the CEBAF beam is very clean, and is contained within $\pm 0.5$ mm with halo at the level 
of less than $10^{-5}$. It is expected that the beams from the 12 GeV machine will be of comparable quality, at least for up to 3-pass 
beams (up $\sim 6.6$ GeV), so the primary electron beam should cleanly pass through the “dead zone” gap of the HPS setup. 
 
For optimizing the vertexing performance and acquiring physics data, an asymmetric beam profile is desirable. Since the vertex resolution 
in the non-bend plane will be high, beam sizes of $<50 ~\mu$m in the Y direction are preferable. The momentum measurement will not benefit 
from small beam sizes in the X direction, and if the beam sizes in both dimensions are too small, the target foil will overheat. For these reasons the 
required beam sizes for HPS will be $\sigma_X \sim 250 \mu$m and $\sigma_Y < 50 \mu$m.
The HPS beam parameter requirements are presented in Table \ref{tb:beam}.

\caption{ Required beam parameters.} 
\label{tb:beam}
\end{table}

The B-line optics in the $6$ GeV era was checked using simulation and a beam test of the system. The optics program ELEGANT \cite{elegant} was 
used to determine the optimized B-line parameters needed to achieve an asymmetric beam size, $\sigma_X \approx 250 \mu$m and $\sigma_Y\approx 
20 \mu$m, at the HPS test run target location. 
Beam tests were conducted in Hall B to validate these optics simulations during the Two Photon Exchange experiment when $2.2$ GeV beam was 
available (February of 2011). Parameters were set for a beam profile of $\sigma_X \approx 300 ~\mu$m and $\sigma_Y\approx 10 \mu$m at the 
Hall B ”tagger” beam profiler ($\sim 8$ meters upstream of the proposed HPS target location). Several beam profile scans with different 
scanner and data readout speeds were performed to check the beam stability and the systematics in the measurements. 
One of the scans is shown in Figure \ref{fig:profile_test}. As can be seen from the figure, the required profile can be reliably  achieved. 
Several scans performed over two hours resulted in a consistent and stable beam profile. Based on the width of the Y-profile, beam position 
stability is  $< 20 \mu$m. Note that any beam motion with more than 10 $\mu$m amplitude and faster than 1Hz is included in the scan.

% {\bf {\it ELEGANT for 12 GeV machine} from Arne}
The beamline optimizations have been performed for the 12 GeV CEBAF machine including the proposed changes for Hall-B/CLAS12 operations. 
Using the program ELEGANT and inputting the new locations of magnetic elements and their field maps, the beam profile was optimized at the HPS 
target location. In Figure \ref{fig:hps2014} the beam sizes and the beam angles are shown for $6.7$ GeV setup.  The required beam 
size is achievable within the operataing specifications of all the quadrupoles.  Since HPS will run at beam energies $<6.7$ GeV it is straight 
forward to scale (linearly) the magnets down to the other energies.  The beam size/angle (beam transport) remains the same 
for $1.1$, $2.2$, and $4.4$ GeV energies with the exception of the small emittance increase at $6.7$ GeV.

 \subsubsection{Beam Diagnostics}
 \label{setup:beam_dignostics}
 
Beam position and current will be controlled using inputs from two sets of cavity beam position monitors (BPMs), that are located in the 
upstream tunnel. 
Sets of corrector dipoles and quadrupoles are routinely used to tune the beam for Hall B (2C21 to 2C24). A pair of BPMs, 2C21 and 2C24, 
will define the incoming trajectory of the beam and are included in the fast feedback loop. Readings from these BPMs will be used to 
maintain stable beam positions and currents. The stability of beam positions at two different locations also ensures the stability of the 
beam inclination.
 
The beam profile will be measured using three wire scanners. Two are installed in the tunnel, the first one at 2C23, and the second one before the 
Hall-B tagger magnet, (2c24 harp, called "tagger harp"), about 8 meters upstream of the HPS target. The third wire harp, 2H00 harp, will 
be located just before the first chicane dipole. The first two profilers will be used to establish the required beam parameters during the 
initial setup. The Hall-B tagger magnet will be energized when beam tune is in progress, diverting the beam away from the HPS apparatus.
After an acceptable beam profile is achieved, the tagger magnet will be degaussed and turned off, and the beam 
will be put through the HPS system and the beam profile will be checked using the 2H00 wire harp. 
The backgrounds in the HPS silicon tracker from beam profiling using the 2H00 harp have been simulated. At $5$ nA beam current, the 
radiation damage is equivalent to about $10$ sec. of production beam current on the HPS target, so is not a concern.

A set of tungsten beam-fiducial wires will be installed immediately in front of the silicon detectors in the experiment's analyzing magnet. One horizontal wire, 20 micron diameter, and one 30 micron wire at 9 degrees to the horizontal, will be mounted on a frame attached to the upper movable silicon support plate, and similarly for the bottom plate. The frames for the wires are wide enough that they do not occlude the silicon active area. The wires can be used to locate the position of the beam relative to the silicon. To accomplish this safely, the vertical separation between the front silicon sensor and its nearest wire is 8 mm. This separation, and the small wire diameters, also means that, when the sensors are positioned for data taking, the wires will have a negligible effect on acceptance. The wires are also available for use as a fairly conventional wire scanner. In particular they can provide information about the minor and major axes, and the tip angle (roll), of a strongly elliptical beam.

An insertable YAG screen beam viewer will be installed in the downstream alcove of Hall-B, before the Faraday cup, $\sim 40$ meters downstream 
of the HPS target. Both the position and profile of the beam will be used to setup the chicane magnets and to monitor beam quality during the run. 
A set of beam halo counters mounted along the beam line provides continuous and fast monitoring of the beam conditions. These counters are 
like those used for beam profile measurements. Excess noise in the beam halo counters triggers the machine fast
shutdown system (FSD) in order to terminate beam in the event of beam excursions which could damage the HPS detectors. The FSD will occur 
in less than 40 $\mu$s. In addition to halo counters, a beam offset monitor (BOM) will be installed upstream of the 2H00 wire harp. It is 
similar to the BOM used in CLAS. A short quartz cylinder, about $6$ mm OD and $4$ mm ID, with optical fibers attached around the edge will be centered 
on the beam. Even a few electrons in the beam tail will generate light in the cylinder that will be detected in a multi-anode PMT attached to 
the readout fibers. Errant beam motion towards the collimator located upstream of the tagger magnet will generate more light and increase the counts 
in the quartz cylinder, signalling a potential problem. The BOM will be wired to FSD as part of the equipment protection system. 
 
\subsubsection{Vacuum chambers} 
\label{vacchamb}
 
The SVT vacuum box will be attached to the existing magnet vacuum chamber as shown in Figure \ref{fig:svtvbox}. Power, high voltage, and data 
signals to and from the hybrids are connected through two $8$" flanges on the sides of the vacuum box. Two vertical linear motion mechanisms 
driven by stepper motors 
are used to position the SVT upper and lower modules with a precision of $1.25 ~\mu$m/step. A third linear motion mechanism is used to position 
the target on or off the beam. All the stepper motors are placed at a large enough distance from the magnet to avoid any ill effect from the 
magnetic fringe field.
An existing stepper motor driver and  EPICS-based control software will be used.   
 
\begin{figure*}[t]
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{beamline/svt_in.pdf}
\caption{\small{Rendering of the SVT inside the Hall-B pair spectrometer vacuum chamber and the upstream vacuum box with SVT and target connections.}}\label{fig:svtvbox}
\end{figure*}

The scattering chamber between the top and bottom parts of the ECal is a critical beamline element. In order to keep the calorimeter as close as 
possible to the beam plane, include sufficient thermal insulation for the ECal, and maintain as wide a vacuum gap as possible, the top and bottom 
plates of the scattering chamber must be quite thin. At the location where the primary beams  ($e^-$ and $\gamma$) exit, the openings in the 
chamber have been enlarged. In Figure \ref{fig:ecalv} a rendering of the scattering chamber in between the two halves of the ECAL is shown. The 
front flange of the chamber connects directly to the magnet vacuum chamber. Vacuum is maintained only on the electron side (beam right) since 
the backgrounds on the positron side are negligible.  
This design is based on detailed GEANT4 simulations of the background rates and acceptance of the ECal. It places crystals within 20 mm 
from the beam plane to maximize low-mass acceptance. In order to avoid excessive deformation of the thin walls of the vacuum chamber, an aluminum 
honeycomb support is inserted between the upper and lower walls, to beam's right.

The ECal vacuum chamber will be connected to the muon system vacuum chamber, located between the two halves of the muon system. Special openings for 
the photon and electron beams are not needed in the muon system vacuum chamber. The gaps for the radiated secondary electrons are essentially 
projections of those in the ECal vacuum chamber. At its 
upstream end, the muon vacuum chamber will have a gap of $\sim 5$ cm. At the downstream end that gap will be $\sim 7.5$ cm.

The last vacuum chamber, which passes through the third dipole, does not need to have a narrow opening. It will have size of the Frascati H magnet 
gap. At the downstream end of this chamber, there will be flange with two exit windows, a Kapton window for the photon beam to exit the chamber 
and go to 
the photon beam dump through a Helium bag, and a vacuum continuation to the standard beam line for the electron beam to go to the Hall-B 
electron beam dump. 

\begin{figure*}[t]
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{beamline/ecal_vac.pdf}
\caption{\small{Rendering of the ECal and the ECal vacuum chamber.}}\label{fig:ecalv}
\end{figure*}
 
\subsubsection{Beam dumps and shieldings} 

The Hall-B electron beam dump will be used to terminate the electron beam. Due to its high intensity, the beam will not be dumped in the Faraday 
cup (FC); instead, the existing beam blocker before the FC will be used to terminate the beam. The photon beam will be dumped in a photon beam dump, 
which will be a hut  made of lead bricks located on the space frame. There will be a shielding wall after the last chicane magnet to prevent 
radiation from reaching the detector systems on the downstream side of the Hall.

\subsubsection{Targets} 
\label{target}

A thin tungsten foil is used as the target. High Z material is
chosen for its short radiation length, to minimize the hadronic
production relative to the electromagnetic trident and $A'$
production. The target is located 10 cm in front of the first
plane of silicon strip detectors.

The primary target, 10 mm square, is 0.00125 radiation lengths
(approximately 4 $\mu$m tungsten). Mounted immediately above it
is a similar area of 0.0025 radiation lengths, available for some
of the data taking, adjusting the beam current as appropriate.
The foil can be fully retracted from the beam, and is inserted on
to the beam line from above, using a stepping motor linear
actuator. The bottom edge of the foil is free-standing so there
is no thick support frame to trip the beam when the target is
inserted. Its position is adjustable vertically allowing either
thickness to be selected, and different sections of the
tungsten can be used in the event of beam damage. The support
frame on the beam-right side of the target is made thin enough to
prevent radiation damage to the silicon in the event of an errant
beam caused, for example, by an upstream chicane magnet trip.
               
The target is intended to operate with beam currents up to 500
nA, which produce strong local heating. The strength of tungsten
drops by an order of magnitude with temperature increases in the
range of 1000 C. In addition, the material re-crystallizes above
this range, which increases the tendency for cracking where
thermal expansion has caused temporary dimpling. For these
reasons, it was decided to keep the temperature rise less than
about 1000 degrees, which is accomplished by selecting an
adequately large beam spot area. For example at 200 nA the rms
beam radii will be held above 20 by 250 $\mu$m, or 40 by 250
$\mu$m for 400 nA. Simulations have shown that these beam spot
sizes do not diminish the pair reconstruction resolution of the
experiment.
