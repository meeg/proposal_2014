 \subsection{HPS beamline}
 
 \subsubsection{Layout} 
 
The HPS experiment will use the same three magnet chicane that was used for the CLAS Two Photon Exchange experiment (TPE). The layout of the beam line and the chicane is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ebeam}. The Hall B pair spectrometer magnet, 18D36 (pole length $91.44$ cm, gap $45.72\times 15.24$ cm$^2$, max-field $1.5$ T), will serve as the analyzing magnet. The dipole field direction (Y) is perpendicular to the horizontal (XZ) plane. A Hall B “Frascati” H magnets (pole length $50$ cm, gap $21\times 8.25$ cm$^2$, max-field $1.2$ T) will be used as the first and the last dipoles of the chicane. The analyzing magnet will be operated at a $0.25$ T-m field for $1.1$ GeV, a $0.5$ T-m field for $2.2$ GeV, and a $1.5$ T-m field for $6.6$ GeV running. The two bending magnets will be set to  $0.125$ T-m, $0.25$ T-m, and $0.75$ T-m fields, respectively. The distance between the centers of the magnets will be about $50$ cm bigger than it for the TPE run. The location of the analyzing along the beam will be exactly at the same place as for the TPE run. In transverse direction it will be displaced ito beam left by $\sim 11$ cm in order to optimize the detector acceptance for e$^+$ and e$^-$, see Figure \ref{fig:ebeamt}.

\end{figure*}

 
The target foil is positioned at the upstream edge of the magnet's pole face. The distance from the target to the first layer of the silicon tracker is 10 cm, and to the face of the electromagnetic calorimeter downstream, $\sim 137$ cm. There is continuous vacuum for the electron beam throughout the entire setup ending in the Hall B electron beam dump. The analyzing magnet, the Hall B pair spectrometer dipole, has its own power supply. The “Frascati” H magnets will use one common power supply and will be powered by the Hall B "mini-torus" power supply. There will be a shunt installed between the two “Frascati” magnets to allow independent small changes in currents on those two magnets if necessary (as it was done during the TPE experiment, although never used). Both power supplies are bipolar, so the magnets can be degaussed when needed. From available field map data at $900$ A, the$\int{Bdl}$ of these magnets along the path of the electron beam is $0.663$ T-m. The specified max current for these magnets is $950$ A. In order to get $0.75$ T-m an additional $10\%$ increase in field value will be needed. From initial evaluation of the magnet design and characteristics, it should not be a problem to run them at $10\%$ higher currents over the specified max current. However, reducing the gap by $1/3$ inch can be done if necessary.

The SVT vacuum box is mounted on the upstream end of the analyzing magnet vacuum chamber to provide connections for the SVT motion system, the cooling system, power and signal cables, and the target motion system. The Ecal vacuum chamber is attached to the downstream end of the analyzing magnet vacuum chamber, above and below which are placed the Ecal modules. Downstream of the Ecal vacuum chamber, another vacuum chamber is attached, leading through the muon system and the downstream chicane magnet. For the beam line upstream of the SVT vacuum box and downstream of the chicane magnet, the standard vacuum beam line of Hall B, with a few small modifications, will be used. 
 
\subsubsection{Running Conditions} 
 
The HPS will use $\sim 1.1$ GeV, $\sim 2.2$ GeV, and $\sim 6.6$ GeV electron beams of up to $500$ nA incident on a tungsten (W) target. Operational experience (with 6 GeV) showed that the CEBAF beam is very clean, and is contained within $\pm 0.5$ mm with halo at the level of less than $10^{-5}$. It is expected that behavior of the 12 GeV machine will be understood at the same level, at least for up to 3-pass beams (up $\sim 6.6$ GeV), so there should not be any issue of primary electron beam passing through the “dead zone” gap of the HPS setup. 
 
For checking the vertexing performance and acquiring physics data, an asymmetric beam profile is desirable. Since the vertex resolution in the non-bend plane will be high, beam sizes of $20-30 ~\mu$m in the Y direction are preferable. The momentum measurement will not benefit from small beam sizes in the X direction, and small beam sizes in both dimensions will overheat the target foil. For these reasons the required beam sizes for HPS will be $\sigma_X \sim 250 \mu m$ and $\sigma_Y \sim 30 \mu m$.
 
 The HPS beam parameter requirements are presented in Table \ref{tb:beam}.

The B-line optics in $6$ GeV era was checked using simulation and beam test of the system. The optics program ELEGANT \cite{elegant} was used to determine the optimized B-line parameters needed to achieve an asymmetric beam size at the HPS test run target location. Results of this optimization are presented in Figure \ref{fig:hpstest}. An asymmetric beam profile with $\sigma_X \approx 250 \mu m$ and $\sigma_Y\approx 20 \mu m$ is achievable.

\end{figure*}

Beam tests were conducted in Hall B to validate these optics simulations during the Two Photon Exchange experiment when $2.2$ GeV beam was available (February of 2011). Parameters were set for a beam profile of $\sigma_X \approx 300 ~\mu$m and $\sigma_Y\approx 10 \mu$m at the Hall B ”tagger” beam profiler ($\sim 8$ meters upstream of the proposed HPS target location). Several beam profile scans with different scanner speeds and data readout were performed to check for systematics. 
One of the scans is shown in Figure \ref{fig:profile_test}. As can be seen from the figure, the required profile can be reliably  achieved. Several scans performed over two hours resulted consistent, stable beam profile. Based on the width of the Y-profile, beam position stability is  $< 20 \mu$m. Note: any beam motion with more than 10 $\mu$m amplitude and faster than 1Hz is included in the scan.

 \subsubsection{Beam Diagnostics}
 
The HPS run uses the Hall-B beam line as is (after slight modifications for 12 GeV). Beam position and current will be controlled by two sets of cavity beam position monitors (BPMs), that are located in the upstream tunnel. Sets of corrector dipoles and quadrupoles are routinely used to tune the beam for Hall B (2C21 to 2C24). A pair of BPMs, 2C21 and 2C24, will define the incoming trajectory of the beam and are included in the fast feedback loop. Readings from these BPMs will be used to maintain stable beam positions and currents.
 
The beam profile will be measured using three wire scanners, two installed in the tunnel, first one at 2C23, the second one before the Hall-B tagger magnet, (2c24 harp, called "tagger harp"), about 8 meters upstream of the HPS target. The last wire harp, 2H00 harp, will be located just before the first chicane dipole . First two profilers will be used to establish the required beam parameters during the initial setup. The Hall-B tagger magnet will be energized when beam tune is in progress. After acceptable beam profile is achieved, beam will be put through the HPS system (tagger magnet will be degaussed and turned off) and beam profile will be checked using 2H00 wire harp. 

There will be beam viewer installed in the downstream alcove of Hall-B, before Faraday cap, $\sim 40$ meters downstream of the HPS target. Beam position and beam profile will be used to setup the chicane magnets and to monitor beam quality during the run. A set of beam halo counters mounted along the beam line provides fast monitoring of the beam conditions. These counters are like those used for beam profile measurements. Excess noise in the beam halo counters triggers the machine fast
shutdown system (FSD) in order to terminate beam in the event of beam excursions which could damage the HPS detectors. In addition to halo counters, a beam offset monitor (BOM) will be installed upstream of the 2H00 wire harp. It is similar to BOM used in CLAS. A short quartz cylinder, about $1$ cm in diameter, with optical fibers attached around the edge will be centered on the beam. Few electrons on the beam tail will generate light in the cylinder that will be detected in a multi-anode PMT attached to readout fibers. Any beam motion towards the cylinder will generate more light and increase counts in the PMT scalers. BOM will be wired to FSD as part of the equipment protection system. 
 
\subsubsection{Vacuum chambers} 
\label{vacchamb}
 
The SVT vacuum box will be attached to the existing magnet vacuum chamber as shown in Figure \ref{fig:svtvbox}. Power, high voltage, and data signals to and from the hybrids are connected through two $8$" flanges on the sides of the vacuum box, which each have six 50-pin vacuum rated D-connectors. Two vertical linear motion mechanisms driven by stepper motors 
are used to position the SVT upper and lower modules with a precision of $1.25 ~\mu$m/step. A third linear motion mechanism is used to position the target on or off the beam. All the stepper motors are placed at a large enough distance from the magnet to avoid any ill effect from the magnetic field.
An existing stepper motor driver and  EPICS-based control software will be used. Two $2-3/4$" flanges separately accommodate the cooling line feedthroughs for the SVT upper and lower modules. The cooling line has a flow switch which is interlocked with the SVT power supply crate such that the power supply can be enabled only when cooling flow is present. The cooling line inlet and outlet temperatures are monitored and recorded.

\end{figure*}

The scattering chamber between the top and bottom parts of the ECal is a critical beamline element. In order to keep the calorimeter as close as possible to the beam plane, include sufficient thermal insulation for the ECal (which must be temperature controlled), and maintain as wide a vacuum gap as possible, the top and bottom plates of the scattering chamber must be quite thin. At the location where the primary beams  ($e^-$ and $\gamma$) exit, the openings in the chamber have been enlarged. In Figure \ref{fig:ecalv} a rendering of the scattering chamber in between two halves of the ECAL is shown. The front flange of the chamber connects directly to the magnet vacuum chamber. Vacuum is maintained only on the electron side (beam right).  This design is based on detailed GEANT4 simulations of background rates and acceptance of the ECal and allows crystals to be within 20 mm from the beam plane. In order to avoid excessive deformation of the thin walls of the vacuum chamber, an aluminum honeycomb support is inserted between the upper and lower walls, to beam's right.

The ECal vacuum chamber will be continued with a scattering chamber between two halves of the muon system. The openings for the photon and electron beams, and for the radiated secondary electrons will be projections of the ECal vacuum chamber. The last scattering chamber, through the third dipole, does not need to have narrow opening, it will have size of the Frascati H magnet gap. At the end of the vacuum chamber there will be flange with two exit windows, a Kapton window for photon beam to exit the chamber and go to the photon beam dump through a Helium bag, and a vacuum continuation to the standard beam line for the electron beam to go to the Hall-B electron beam dump.

\subsubsection{Targets} 
\label{target}
 
A thin tungsten foil is used as the target. High Z material is chosen for its short radiation length, to minimize the hadronic production relative to the electromagnetic trident and $A'$ production.  The target is located 10 cm in front of the first plane of silicon strip detectors. The primary target, 10 mm square, is 0.00125 radiation lengths (approximately 4 microns tungsten). Mounted immediately above it is a similar area of 0.0025 radiation lengths, available for some of the data taking, adjusting the beam current as appropriate. 

The foil can be fully retracted from the beam, and is inserted on to the beam line from above, using a stepping motor linear actuator. The bottom edge of the foil is free-standing so there is no thick support frame to trip the beam when the target is inserted. Its position is adjustable vertically, allowing either thickness to be selected, and different sections of the tungsten can be used in the event of damage.

The target is designed to operate with beam currents up to 200 nA, which produce strong local heating. The strength of tungsten drops by an order of magnitude with temperature increases in the range of 1000 C. In addition, the material re-crystallizes above this range, which increases the tendency for cracking where thermal expansion has caused  temporary dimpling. For these reasons, it was decided to keep the temperature rise below about 1000 degrees, which is accomplished by keeping the rms beam radius above 70 microns (for a round beam spot). However, a strongly elliptical beam spot is advantageous for constraining the vertex position during data analysis. A spot of, for example, 20 by 250 microns will also have an acceptable temperature rise.

In addition to the target, a set of tungsten beam-fiducial wires has been installed immediately in front of the silicon detectors. One horizontal wire, 20 micron diameter, and one 30 micron wire at 9 degrees to the horizontal, are mounted on a frame attached to the upper silicon support plate, and similarly for the bottom plate. The frames for the wires are wide enough that they do not occlude the silicon active area. The wires can be used to locate the position of the beam relative to the silicon. To accomplish this safely, the vertical separation between the front silicon sensor and its nearest wire is 8 mm. This separation, and their small diameters, also means that, when the sensors are positioned for data taking, the wires have a negligible effect on acceptance.

The wires are also available for use as a fairly conventional wire scanner. In particular they can provide information about the minor and major axes, and the tip angle (roll), of a strongly elliptical beam
