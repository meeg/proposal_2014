We plan to execute the experiment in two settings using the same apparatus. First, perform a commissioning run with modest physics output, then, after a month or two continue with a longer run at multiple energies to cover as much parameter space as possible. Experimental apparatus will be ready to be commissioned and take physics data in late summer of 2014. The HPS experiment will be ready to use the first physics quality beams available in Hall-B as early as fall of 2014. With assumption that an early running in Hall-B is possible, the proposed run plan for the HPS experiment will be the following: 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Commissioning run in 2014: total of $6$ weeks on the floor with beam:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $2$ weeks of detector commissioning
\item $2$ weeks physics run at $2.2$ GeV
\item $2$ weeks physics run at $1.1$ GeV
\end{itemize}
\item{\bf Physics run in 2015, total of $10$ weeks on the floor with beam:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $2$ weeks of detector commissioning
\item $4$ weeks physics run at $2.2$ GeV
\item $4$ weeks physics run at $6.6$ GeV
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The proposed run plane will cover remaining region of parameter space favored by muon g-2 anomaly, and will buy in significant territory not only at large couplings ($\alpha^\prime/\alpha>10^{-7}$) but also in the regions of small couplings down to $\alpha^\prime/\alpha\sim 10^{-10}$. This small coupling regions are not accessible to any other proposed experiments. The HPS is the only experiment that can cover small coupling region using excellent vertexing capability of the Si-tracker. 

In the proposed run plan we have running at none standard energy for 12 GeV CEBAF, $E=1.1$ GeV, in 2014. In case due to schedule conflicts this will not be possible, we will continue to run at $2.2$ GeV instead. In that case running at $2.2$ GeV will be shorter, and we expect to complete $1.1$ GeV running some time in 2015. The gap between two settings in 2014 and 2015, order of two months, will be used to improve, correct or fix apparatus if necessary.

In summary, we request for the first phase of HPS experiment to run in two settings, first in fall of 2014 total of 3 weeks of beam time (6 weeks on the floor), with beam energies $1.1$ GeV 1 weeks, $2.2$ GeV two weeks. For the second part we request 5 weeks of beam (10 weeks on the floor) that will be equally shared within beam energies $2.2$ GeV and $6.6$ GeV. We expect that the second part of the run will be In 2015.
